      <description>For the past few weeks, I have been revitalizing my old Playpen Ballroom calculator. The apps objective was to help users find out just how many playpen balls could fit inside their room. While I still have a few minor kinks to work out, the Alpha is now available for download. To join the test you can either become a tester on the Google Play Store or get the code off of Github and compile it yourself.</description>

      <description>Hello world! This is my new blog. It&amp;rsquo;s still a work-in-progress. There are a ton of changes I have to make to the theme, including fixing that nasty flexbox categories/tags misalignment in the CSS, tidying up the projects page, and documenting my work. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to keep the site updated often. I also have a custom theme in the works thats much more ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ.</description>
